# A Chess Research using Reinforcement Learning

[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)-based reinforcement learning code for chess determination, which is used in my bachelor degree thesis.

Due to the hardware restrictions, the models were very simple (like demos as I saidðŸ™Š).

Supporting:

- Chess (Current)
- Xiangqi (Upcoming... eventually... (right?ðŸ˜…))
- Shogi (Upcoming... eventually... (right?ðŸ˜…))

Including:

- PyCEFL (Python Chess Environment) (Prototype)
- CEIL (Chess Environment Interpretation Language) (Prototype)
